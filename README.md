# Docker Redundancy Validation Tool - Frontend


This is the GitHub repository for the source code of the project accompanying my 
bachelors thesis. The main goal was to create a tool to validate redundancies in 
a docker-cluster by using the analogy of redundancies and dependencies to elements 
of the graph theory.


## Technology
As this is the frontend application, it is written as a Angular CLI application. To work
properly, an instance of [the backend application](https://github.com/3baltes/drvt-backend)
needs to be running. The layout is based on [CoreUI](https://github.com/mrholek/CoreUI-Free-Bootstrap-Admin-Template).
